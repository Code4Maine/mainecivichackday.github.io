		<description><![CDATA[A passenger rail plan serving the various smaller towns in Maine connecting urban centers and national routes is something the state should have done by now. We believe it needs to be generated at the local level. There are many many moving parts that require a serious exercise in scenario development.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One project idea might be to create an online publicly accessible database of park/green/open spaces and list adopted business or charity group or neighborhood association that maintain or volunteer to clean, garden or improve the asset on a semi-annual basis. This database could use a website based message board where if someone was visiting the park they could leave message to clean graffiti or suggest additional lighting or add a bench or something else that the steward might be responsible for.  I would assume municipal staff would be the primary steward of any public park but perhaps this could be expanded to neighborhood watches or business corridors. There could be corporate sponsors willing to be the steward. Additionaly boy/girl scout groups or church groups might be interested in supporting such a program.  Such a website or app would provide communication to 1) Identify a need; 2) Identify solutions; 3) Coordinate volunteers 4) Support the community 5) Promote use of existing community resources.]]></description>
