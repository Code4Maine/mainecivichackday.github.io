I feel one of the most important pieces of this project will be the ease of adding regions to the map layers.

The other important piece is that a user will need to be able to easily search for their address, perhaps harnessing google maps APIs to get the lat/lon.

Lastly, any civic organization should be able to create layers and define which layers they want to search within - then display the search box and results on their page (iframe?)"</td>

The game would be in the form of the card game ""Memory."" Tapping on a button would reveal a hidden bird song. Tapping on another button would reveal another hidden bird song. If the bird songs match then the identification of the bird would be revealed and those two buttons would vanish. The points would go to that player. The app would need to be turn key and placed on Google Play. No intervention would be required by Fields Pond. All rights would be given to Fields Pond. 
This idea is an extension of another project that was done for Maine Audubon last year. I talked to Cyndi Kuhn at Fields Pond today about it and she likes the idea."</td>

The display would be done in a module type fashion. At least two modules would be required. On would be to carry balls or other mass objects to the top and the other module would be a method for the mass to return to base level.
This project would allow non computer hackers a chance to show off their skills. Teams could take on different modules. After the first two modules are completed and functioning. Other modules could be added on Hack Day or in the future."</td>
